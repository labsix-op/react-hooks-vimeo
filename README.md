# React hooks - Vimeo

This project is currently a work in progress. ðŸš§

## About

This is my very first open source project. Recently, while working on a project, I found a need for a React Hook implementation for Vimeo's player. I was inspired by the [u-wave/react-vimeo](https://github.com/u-wave/react-vimeo/tree/default) library and decided to create a similar one, but with the usage of React hooks, providing a flexible component and a hook for using the Vimeo player.

This project aims to make it simple for developers to include Vimeo's player in their React applications with a modern, hook-based approach.

## Features

The library provides:

- A React hook `useVimeoPlayer` that allows for easy integration with Vimeo's player API.
- A reusable `VimeoPlayer` component that simplifies adding Vimeo players to your React app.

## How to use
